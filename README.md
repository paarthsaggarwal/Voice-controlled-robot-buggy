# Voice-controlled-robot-buggy
Used raspberry pi, microphone and speaker to develop robot car buggy which is controlled by human voice. It could go LEFT, FORWARD, RIGHT and STOP based on the command issued by the human.

The sample code is attached.

Make sure all libraries are installed correctly.

Because of the space limitation in my house, I was not able to demo this fully.
